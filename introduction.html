         The br tag is a self-closing element, meaning it doesn’t require a closing tag. It’s commonly used in addresses, poetry, or any situation where a line break is needed for better readability.
        <br><br>
         <b>Note:</b> The br tag also supports the Global Attributes and Event Attributes in HTML.</p>
